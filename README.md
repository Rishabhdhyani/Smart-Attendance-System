# Smart-Attendance-System

This project is mode on Smart India Hackathon. The problem statement is given by Government of Sikkim which states that design
a small display board for displaying the number of students present during the first period. The class teacher locks the number
and later others teachers can check the display for verification. Design a hardware based solution using CCTV camers that
captures entry and exit of students in a class room. Additionally it should have ability to count the number of students in the
class periodically.

For software part we have built Convolutional Neural Network Model to count no of students and we have used TFT screen to display
the count and statistics.In order to keep the record and database we have also created web server.
